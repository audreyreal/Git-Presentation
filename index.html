        <h2>Why use Git?</h2>
        <p>
          People use git because it allows developers to work on the same
          project simultaneously, as well as keep track of changes between
          different versions and have the ability to roll back to previous
          versions should something go wrong. The convenience of all that in one
          tool is unparalelled.
